## 2. Create a Bootable USB stick
To install Ubuntu Desktop, you need to write your downloaded ISO to a USB stick to create the installation media. This is not the same as copying the ISO, and requires some bespoke software.

We will use Rufus. You can download it [here](https://rufus.ie/en/)

Scroll down until you found **rufus 3.XX Portable** and download it

Plug your USB Drive (atau Flashdisk yak) to your laptop.

**[IMPORTANT] Backup your data because we will format the USB Drive.**

Open rufus file that you have downloaded before. Because it's portable, you can langsung use it.

In the main windows of rufus, click select.
